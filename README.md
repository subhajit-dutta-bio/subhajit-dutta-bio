- 👋 Hi, I’m Subhajit Dutta @subhajit-dutta-bio
- 👀 I’m interested in molecular and cell biology and using big data to understand the complexity of biological systems, particularly in cancer.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a senior researcher at the University Medical Center Hamburg- Eppendorf (UKE), Germany under the University of Hamburg. Previously I worked at CSIR-IGIB (Delhi, India), IIT Jodhpur (Jodhpur, India), University of Helsinki (Helsinki, Finland) and NISER (Bhubaneswar, India).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different data-driven ML-guided projects to understand tumour microenvironment, cell communication & migration.
- 📫 How to reach me? Drop an email to dsubhajit.edu@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- 💡 I love to dig deeper into functional genomics data, imaging data, and multi-dimensional molecular data using state-of-the-art ML models.
